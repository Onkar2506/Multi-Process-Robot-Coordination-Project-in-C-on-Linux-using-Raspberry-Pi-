# Multi-Process-Robot-Coordination-Project-in-C-on-Linux-using-Raspberry-Pi-
# Mobile Robot Simulator on Linux (Raspberry Pi Compatible)

This project simulates multiple mobile robots moving towards their targets in a shared 2D environment with collision avoidance, using **C**, **POSIX processes**, **shared memory**, and **semaphores**.

Designed to run efficiently on **Raspberry Pi** with a **Linux** OS.
